This repository contains my experiments with the Natural Language Processing Concepts. We start off by predicting the next letter in the famous 'DaVinci Code' novel. 

The Jupyter notebook has the below steps:

1.Loading the data
2.Tokenizing the text in the novel at a character level
3.Build Input and Output sequences of 100 characters length
4.One-hot encode the output
5.Build the Model using a LSTM layer
6.Use the trained model to predict the next character
